# Traveling-Tourist-Problem
In this project we designed a Traveling Tourist Assistant by modifying some aspects of the Traveling Salesman Problem. 

Our goal was to answer the question: "Given a list of tourist attractions, distances between each pair of attractions, and a touristic characteristic of each attraction, what is the best possible route that a tourist should take subject to time and money constraints?" We called it the Traveling Tourist Problem. 

The route starts and ends at the same location (like hotel, train station). The touristic characteristic is a score that captures the value of multiple features of the attraction such as popularity and cost of visiting the attraction in terms of time and money.
